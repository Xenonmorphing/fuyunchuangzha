since the general.html is attach with script.js. So general.html page should be has these elements, 
1. hp with 3
2. timer of 10s
3. item elimination card(https://imgur.com/a/gzRWvMj.png), key card to go d door(https://imgur.com/b20hgGa.png) and addhp card(https://imgur.com/pYKUYaH.png)
4. 3 random doors a(https://i.imgur.com/mL3vqAO.png),b(https://imgur.com/wCgkrm3.png),c(https://imgur.com/GcBnXpW.png),d(https://imgur.com/cYgi26i.png), 4 door choose 3 only

door rules:
in each round, the player is presented with 3 random gates (A / B / C / D, duplicates allowed).
The player must choose one gate before the timer runs out.
If the player fails to choose in time, it is considered a wrong choice and –1 HP is applied.

Gate Outcomes
Each gate has two possible outcomes:
Encounter the Nian Beast
Player loses 1 HP.

In every round:
At least 1 gate is a “bad gate”
At most 2 gates are “bad gates”

Safe Passage
The player passes safely and may receive one of the following:
Elimination Card: Reveals 1 “bad gate”
+1 HP (only works if HP is not already full)
Key: Used to unlock Gate D
Or no item (safe passage only)

Special Rules for Gate D
Gate D is the safest, but still has a very small chance of containing the Nian Beast.
The player must have a Key to choose Gate D.
Without a Key, Gate D cannot be selected.

x means nothing happens, just go to number page
y means can get either elimination card, key or addhp, so go to page respectively and back to number page
z means go to minushp.html -> nian1.html or nian2.html

if player lose all hp then go to thanks.html, without changing pages image order and word order, add these!
